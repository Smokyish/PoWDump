## Example bots
The scripts in this package can be used as examples for writing your own bots.

### How to run the bots
The easiest way to run the bots would be to use `ts-node` with `npx`.

By just calling the script with `npx ts-node <script>` you'll see what the expected script parameters are.

```
npx ts-node src/SCRIPT.ts
```
